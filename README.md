This repository contains the architectural diagrams and documentation for the OpenArmor project, an advanced open-source security platform.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

Our repository is organized into several key components:

- FIM/db
- centralized_configuration
- data_provider
- dbsync
- metrics
- openarmor-db
- router-pubsub
- syscollector
- vulnerability-scanner/policyManager
- wm_azure
- wm_ciscat
- wm_gcp
- wm_github
- wm_office365
- wm_sca

Each directory contains PlantUML files that describe the architecture and workflows of the respective components.
